# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

Download and install docker. Verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal: 
`docker -v` and `docker-compose -v`

Then, run docker-compose up from the project root directory to load Anythink's backend and frontend.

If Docker is working, the backend should be running and able to connect to your local database.

Test it by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3000/api/ping

To check the frontend and make sure itâ€™s connected to the backend, you can create a new user on http://localhost:3001/register
